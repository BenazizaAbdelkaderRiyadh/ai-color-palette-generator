# br-Palette AI

br-Palette AI is a modern, AI-powered color palette generator designed for creatives, designers, and developers. Simply describe a mood, theme, or concept, and the application leverages Google's Gemini API to generate a beautiful and harmonious 5-color palette, complete with semantic naming to guide your design process.

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Generation**: Get unique color palettes from a simple text description (e.g., "Misty forest morning," "Cyberpunk cityscape").
- **Semantic Naming**: Colors aren't just hex codes; they come with descriptive names like "Background," "Primary," or "Accent" to inform their use.
- **Instant UI Preview**: See how your generated palette looks on a sample UI component layout, providing immediate context.
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Preview your colors in both light and dark themes within the UI preview to ensure accessibility and versatility.
- **Generate Variations**: Not quite right? Create four subtle variations of your current palette with a single click to explore adjacent possibilities.
- **Save Favorites**: Store your favorite palettes in your browser's local storage for easy access later.
- **Copy & Share**: Easily copy hex codes to your clipboard or share a unique URL that will load your exact palette for others.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive interface that works beautifully on any device.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling workflow.
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`) for fast and high-quality palette generation.
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and a custom `useLocalStorage` hook for persistence.
- **Build Tool**: Vite (as implied by the project setup).
